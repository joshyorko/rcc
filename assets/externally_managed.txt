[externally-managed]
Error=by Robocorp tooling called `rcc`.

 To install Python packages into this managed environment, those should
 be added to `conda.yaml` file, or more generally into "environment
 configuration files".

 Motivation with these kind of managed environments is, that they provide:
 - repeatability, so that same environment can be recreated later
 - isolation, so that different automations can have their own dependencies
 - as few as possible dependency resolutions (currently two: conda and pypi)
 - support for "foreign machines", and not just your own personal machine
 - supporting Windows, MacOS, and linux operating systems with same automations

 If you don't need above features, or need more flexibility in your personal
 developement environment, consider using something else (like virtualenv or
 poetry) with your personal tooling, and only use `rcc` managed environments
 for final delivery to your users and customers.
